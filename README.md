# BP Game Project (SFML)

A simple Sudoku game implemented in **C++17** with **SFML 2.6** for our BP project.  
I used SFML so I could have more freedom in graphics and interaction.  
What I liked most was the chance to spice it up with a little story:  
youâ€™re a spy taking a test to prove your skills.
